# xtal-soap

I stand guilty of being one of the hoards of developers who got excited about dumping the awfully complex SOAP in favor of REST, as part of the AJAX stampede.  In retrospect, I don't remember what was so bad about SOAP, other than JS was so limited at the time, REST was just easier.  Supposedly performance was worse, but I don't know that I ever saw any measurements, just accepted it on gospel faith.

Of course GraphQL is the new shiny tow, but in the meantime some existing services still use SOAP, and JS is a lot more powerful now, so many working with SOAP isn't too bad.

XtalSoap also provides the chance to test out some experiments as far as creating custom elements.
